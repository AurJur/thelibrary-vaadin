## Spent time:

- Task 1: 2 hours (no use of Copilot at all)(choosing Front End framework, registering at github, etc)
- Task 2: 15 hours (install MySQL, loosing Copilot license / GitHub invitation, learn about DB, MySQL, Flyway, implement
  migration, as most of the time was spent not for coding, but for researching and learning things, use of Copilot was
  very minimal (saved maybe 1 minute in total) )
- Task 3: at some Copilot became a nuisance so that I had to disable it.

## Running the project:

- Install MySQL
- Create a database named `thelibrary`
- Create a user named `root` with password `root`

- Clone the repository
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
- Run App.java in the IDE (Java 17 needed)

- Open `http://localhost:8080/login` in your browser
- Login with username `admin` and password `password`
